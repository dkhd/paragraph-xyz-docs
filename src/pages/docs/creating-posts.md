Add a title, or add categories to your posts.

Categories are used to keep your content organized in your dashboard, as well as in your public-facing blog. For example, your readers can click on a post category and browse all posts filed under that category.

Click the gear to edit your post settings. Choose a cover image, modify the post slug, and add a friendly post preview.


Switch between WYSIWYG and markdown editing by using the toggle at the bottom.

## The Editor

All rich text editing starts with the slash command.

Press `/` and insert callouts, headers, images, and more.
