Paragraph provides a handful of tools to customize your publication and truly make it your own. All options can be found on your [Paragraph publication settings](https://paragraph.xyz/settings/publication/blog).

## Adding links

Links are used to organize your publication. Links are displayed above your posts on your homepage. You can link to...

* **Any external URLs**. Link to your Discord, Twitter, or anything else.
* **Any Paragraph URLs**. Link to specific posts, categories (ie `https://paragraph.xyz/@blog/category/web3`), or communities.


## Theming

Customize the background and foreground colors of your publication.
