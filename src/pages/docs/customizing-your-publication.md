Paragraph provides a handful of tools to customize your publication and truly make it your own. All options can be found on your [Paragraph publication settings](https://paragraph.xyz/settings/publication/blog).

---

## Adding Links

Links are used to organize your publication. Links are displayed above your posts on your homepage. You can link to...

* **Any external URLs**. Link to your Discord, Twitter, or anything else.
* **Any Paragraph URLs**. Link to specific posts, categories (ie `https://paragraph.xyz/@blog/category/web3`), or communities. (These load instantly for your users).


## Theming

Customize the background and foreground colors of your publication.

In the future, you'll be able to change fonts and perform even more customization.


## Custom Domains

Custom domains give your publication polish and help with SEO discovery. For a one-time $50 fee, you can purchase a custom domain directly from directly within Paragraph. After this is unlocked for your account, you can use any domain in your possession for your Paragraph newsletter.

## Analytics

Within your newsletter settings, add your Google Analytics ID to keep track of pageviews, your audience growth, and more.
